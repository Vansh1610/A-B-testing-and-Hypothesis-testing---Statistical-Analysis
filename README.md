# A/B Testing and Hypothesis Testing:  Association between having an active LinkedIn Premium subscription and a job search success rate

This project investigates the correlation between LinkedIn Premium subscription and job search success rate using experimental study design and statistical analysis methods. The analysis leverages A/B testing, hypothesis testing, and statistical techniques such as t-tests, correlation analyses, and power analysis to evaluate the impact of LinkedIn Premium on improving users' chances of job success.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To determine whether having a LinkedIn Premium subscription increases the likelihood of job search success.
- **Methodology**: A/B testing was employed to compare two groups â€“ users with LinkedIn Premium and users without it. Statistical tests were applied to analyze the results.
- **Tools Used**: IBM SPSS was used for the statistical tests, including t-tests and correlation analyses. Power analysis was also performed to ensure the validity of the experimental results.

## Key Features

### 1. Independent Samples T-Test Analysis
We conducted an Independent Samples T-Test to compare job success rates between two groups: LinkedIn Premium users and non-Premium users. This test helped determine whether there was a statistically significant difference in success rates between the groups based on their LinkedIn subscription status.

### 2. Correlation Analysis
A Correlation Analysis was performed to examine the relationship between various networking activities (e.g., number of connections, message frequency) and job search success. This analysis assessed the strength and direction of the association between networking behaviors and successful job outcomes.

## Tools & Libraries

- **IBM SPSS**: Used for performing t-tests, correlation analyses, and data visualizations.


## Methodologies

- **T-Test**: Conducted to examine the difference in average job success rates between users with LinkedIn Premium and those without.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Applied to evaluate the link between LinkedIn networking activities (such as connection-building and messaging) and the likelihood of job success.
- **Power Analysis**: Performed to verify that the sample size was sufficient to identify a meaningful statistical effect, if present.

## Results

1. Using the T-test, we found that we can reject the null hypothesis and there is an association between LinkedIn premium and job success rate, which means that p-value is less than 0.05
2. Using the Power Analysis, we found that the data size was sufficient for the analysis and the test
3. Using the Correlation analysis, we found a high correlation between networking and job success rate.
